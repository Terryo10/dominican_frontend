                <p>
                  The Dominican Health Facility is intended to offer health
                  services to the City of Harare and surrounding communities in
                  terms of primary health care delivery especially palliative
                  care with special focus on serious health related illnesses
                  (Covid 19 among them) and the terminally ill needs as well as
                  some of the primary health care services.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3 className="title">The Current Situation</h3>
                <p>
                  Zimbabwe Palliative Care Situational Analysis Report (2014)
                  Although the country report was done in 2014, the findings
                  still stand and made worse by the Covid 19 pandemic. Below are
                  some of the gaps and barriers to palliative care service
                  provision which were highlighted in the report:
                </p>
                <br />
                <ul className="check-list">
                  <li>
                    Few available palliative care services and lack of awareness
                    of the very limited services available.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lack of knowledge and skills among care providers at all
                    levels of the health care delivery system.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Emphasized the need for training on palliative care,
                    bereavement counseling and home-based care and to develop
                    listening and communication skills amongst health
                    professionals.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lack of knowledge and expertise in pain assessment and
                    management using the WHO analgesic ladder.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Bearing in mind of the above findings; our Dominican hospital
                  seeks to therefore actively support the efforts of the
                  Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Careâ€™s response to the
                  WHO mandate to all countries to integrate palliative care
                  services in their countries and Zimbabwe was a signatory of
                  the WHA in 2014 to this effect and an important component of
                  SDG #3. The facility will support this by offering specialist
                  palliative care services in a multi-disciplinary manner as
                  well as acting as a resource facility of palliative care
                  clinical mentoring of health workers at all levels.

                <p>
                  This project will be located at 51 Dublin Road Emerald Hill, a
